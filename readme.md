# Predicting Fire Risk for New York City Census Tracts

### Problem Statement 

Urban fires, especially structural fires, are potentially dangerous incidents that can have devastating outcomes. In 2018 alone, New York City had a total of 27,053 structural fires resulting in the deaths of 88 civilians. While fire departments have worked to improve response times and conduct risk assessment inspections to better identify vulnerable or at-risk properties, there are many obstacles to addressing this risk in its entireity.

This leads us to our problem:
- Using machine learning how accurately can we predict if a census tract will have a structural fire for a given year?
- How accurately can we predict the number of structural fires that will occur in a given census tract for a given year?
